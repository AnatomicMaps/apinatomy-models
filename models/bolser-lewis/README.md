# The Bolser-Lewis ApiNATOMY model of defensive breathing

This digital record documents the ApiNATOMY representation of the neural circuits controlling defensive breathing with components under the influence of the Superior Cervical Ganglion. In particular, this model illustrates predominantly rodent model of pharyngeal and thoracic visceral sensation, as well as descending hypothalamic and medullary neurons to the intermediolateral nucleus (in Rexed lamina VII) whose pre-ganglionic sympathetic neurons project to the superior cervical ganglion. The ensuing post-ganglion neurons fan out to invest the walls of major arteries, structures in the mouth, throat and windpipe, and blood vessels supplying the brain stem. The routes of sensing for laryngeal, epiglottic, carotid body and carotid sinus structures are also modeled. 

ApiNATOMY is a set of tools that produces simple, consistent anatomy schematics overlaid with ontological information. These tools are used to build routing and connectivity graphs (or wiring diagrams).This record contains a docs folder, a source folder, and a README text file. The Docs folder contains a PDF document, with a schematic image of the ApiNATOMY model. The Source folder contains the ApiNATOMY representation of the model in JSON and .xlsx formats. Lastly, the README .md document includes a brief description and keywords associated with the model.
